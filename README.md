# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

` ðŸ”­ I just finished my PhD, entitled "Urban fluctuations in the Nile Delta before the Arabs. Between the Nile river and the Mediterranean sea."`

`ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Â«alwaysÂ» learning or trying to learn php, postgres and python. More recently I started learning D3.js and I will need to return to R since I will need to run soem analyses soon`

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help with my code snippets. I'm not a programmer, I just combine, edit, or make use of code, therefore, most of my code snippets are messy and I am certain that can be improved and corrected. Nevertheless, until now I have solved very specific problems for my own research interests.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to visualize human use of space and if I can't help you I might direct you to the correct people

#### ðŸ“« How to reach me: israel.hinojosa-balino@durham.ac.uk or in Twitter as @ishiba
