# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

` ðŸ”­ I just finished my PhD, entitled "Urban fluctuations in the Nile Delta before the Arabs. Between the Nile river and the Mediterranean sea."`

`ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning or trying to learn PHP, Postgres, and Python. More recently, I started learning D3.js, but I'm currently looking back at Râ€”which I used more than 10 years agoâ€”since I need to run some analyses soon, and yes, they need to be reproducible, as science should always be.`

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help with my code snippets. I'm a programmer, but I also combine, edit, or make use of code created by other and adapt it to my necessities, therefore, some of my code snippets are messy and I am certain that can be improved and corrected. Nevertheless, until now I have solved very specific problems for my own research interests.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to visualizing human use of space, and if I can't help you, I might be able to redirect you to the correct people
